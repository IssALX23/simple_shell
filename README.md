0x16. C - Simple Shell
Description:
Our project is an implementation of a simple shell, essentially a command-line interface that allows users, like me and my partner, to interact with the operating system by typing commands. The shell displays a prompt, $, indicating it's ready for our input. We can enter commands, and the shell interprets and executes them. It supports basic commands, handles errors gracefully, and includes features like executing built-in commands such as exit and env. We also took care to tokenize user input and manage memory efficiently to prevent any memory leaks.

This project was a joint effort between Rajae and Islam, showcasing our skills in C programming, system call usage, memory management, and effective collaboration.
